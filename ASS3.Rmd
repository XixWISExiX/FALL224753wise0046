# Questions{}

## Q 1 NOT DONE
`MS 5.54 - pg 215`
Phishing attacks to email accounts. Refer to the Chance
(Summer, 2007) article on phishing attacks at a company,
Exercise 2.24 (p. 38). Recall that phishing describes an attempt to extract personal/financial information through
fraudulent email. The company set up a publicized email
account—called a “fraud box”—which enabled employees to notify them if they suspected an email phishing attack. If there is minimal or no collaboration or collusion
from within the company, the interarrival times (i.e., the
time between successive email notifications, in seconds)
have an approximate exponential distribution with a mean
of 95 seconds.

  a. What is the probability of observing an interarrival
time of at least 2 minutes?

  b. Data for a sample of 267 interarrival times are saved in
the PHISHING file. Do the data appear to follow an
exponential distribution with $\beta$ = 95?

## Q 2 NOT DONE
`MS 5.56 - pg 215`
Flood level analysis. Researchers have discovered that the
maximum flood level (in millions of cubic feet per sec-
ond) over a 4-year period for the Susquehanna River at
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, follows approximately a gamma
distribution with $\alpha$ = 3 and $\beta$ = .07 (Journal of Quality
Technology, Jan. 1986).

  a. Find the mean and variance of the maximum flood
level over a 4-year period for the Susquehanna River.

  b. The researchers arrived at their conclusions about the
maximum flood level distribution by observing maxi-
mum flood levels over 4-year periods, beginning in 1890. Suppose that over the next 4-year period the
maximum flood level was observed to be .60 million
cubic feet per second. Would you expect to observe a
value this high from a gamma distribution with $\alpha$ = 3
and $\beta$ = .07? What can you infer about the maximum
flood level distribution for the 4-year period observed?

## Q 3 NOT DONE
`MS 5.60 - pg 216`
Reaction to tear gas. The length of time Y (in minutes) re-
quired to generate a human reaction to tear gas formula A
has a gamma distribution with $\alpha$ = 2 and $\beta$ = 2. The dis-
tribution for formula B is also gamma, but with $\alpha$ = 1 and
$\beta$ = 4.

  a. Find the mean length of time required to generate a
human reaction to tear gas formula A. Find the mean
for formula B.

  b. Find the variances for both distributions.

  c. Which tear gas has a higher probability of generating a
human reaction in less than 1 minute? (Hint: You may
use the fact that
$\int ye^{-y/2} dy = -2ye^{-y/2} + \int 2e^{-y/2} dy$
This result is derived by integration by parts.)

## Q 4 NOT DONE
`MS 5.74 - pg 219`
Washing machine repair time. Based on extensive testing,
a manufacturer of washing machines believes that the dis-
tribution of the time Y (in years) until a major repair is re-
quired has a Weibull distribution with $\alpha$ = 2 and $\beta$ = 4.

  a. If the manufacturer guarantees all machines against a
major repair for 2 years, what proportion of all new
washers will have to be repaired under the guarantee?

  b. Find the mean and standard deviation of the length of
time until a major repair is required.
  c. Find $P(\mu-2\sigma \leq Y \leq \mu + 2\sigma$.
  
  d. Is it likely that Y will exceed 6 years?
  
## Q 5 NOT DONE
`MS 5.84 - pg 223`
Laser color printer repairs. The proportion Y of a data-
processing company’s yearly hardware repair budget allo-
cated to repair its laser color printer has an approximate
beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ = 2 and $\beta$ = 9.

  a. Find the mean and variance of Y.

  b. Compute the probability that for any randomly selected
year, at least 40% of the hardware repair budget is used
to repair the laser color printer.

  c. What is the probability that at most 10% of the yearly
repair budget is used for the laser color printer?

## Q 8 NOT DONE
`MS 6.4 - pg 240`
Modeling the behavior of granular media. Refer to the
Engineering Computations: International Journal for
Computer-Aided Engineering and Software (Vol. 30, No.
2, 2013) study of the properties of granular media (e.g.,
sand, rice, ball bearings, and flour), Exercise 3.62 (p. 120).
The study assumes there is a system of N non-interacting
granular particles, where the particles are grouped according to energy level, r. For this problem (as in Exercise
3.62), assume that N = 7 and r = 3, then consider the
scenario where there is one particle (of the total of 7 particles) at energy level 1, two particles at energy level 2, and
four particles at energy level 3. Another feature of the particles studied was the position in time where the particle
reached a certain entropy level during compression. All
particles reached the desired entropy level at one of three
time periods, 1, 2, or 3. Assume the 7 particles had the
characteristics shown in the table. Consider a randomly
selected particle and let X represent the energy level and Y
the time period associated with particle.

Uranium in the Earth’s crust. Refer to the American Mineralogist (October 2009) study of the evolution of uranium minerals in the Earth’s crust, Exercise 5.17 (p. 199).
Recall that researchers estimate that the trace amount of
uranium Y in reservoirs follows a uniform distribution
ranging between 1 and 3 parts per million. In a random

## Q 13 NOT DONE
`MS 6.90 - pg 273`
Mercury contamination of swordfish. Consumer Reports
found widespread contamination of seafood in New York
and Chicago supermarkets. For example, 40% of the
swordfish pieces available for sale have a level of mercury
above the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limit.
Consider a random sample of 20 swordfish pieces from
New York and Chicago supermarkets.

the probability that fewer than 2 of the 20 swordfish pieces
have mercury levels exceeding the FDA limit.

  b. Use the normal approximation to the binomial to calculate the probability that more than half of the 20 swordfish pieces have mercury levels exceeding the FDA limit.

  c. Use the binomial tables to calculate the exact probabilities in parts a and b. Does the normal distribution provide a good approximation to the binomial distribution?

## Q 15 NOT DONE
`MS 7.114 - pg 364`
Solar irradiation study. The Journal of Environmental
Engineering (Feb. 1986) reported on a heat transfer
model designed to predict winter heat loss in wastewater
treatment clarifiers. The analysis involved a comparison of
clear-sky solar irradiation for horizontal surfaces at different sites in the Midwest. The day-long solar irradiation levels (in BTU/sq. ft.) at two midwestern locations
of different latitudes (St. Joseph, Missouri, and Iowa
Great Lakes) were recorded on each of seven clear-sky
winter days. The data are given in the table. Find a 95%
confidence interval for the mean difference between the
day-long clear-sky solar irradiation levels at the two
sites. Interpret the results.

## Q 16 NOT DONE
`MS 7.116 - pg 364`
Diazinon residue in orchards. Pesticides applied to an extensively grown crop can result in inadvertent areawide air contamination. Environmental Science & Technology
(Oct. 1993) reported on air deposition residues of the insecticide diazinon used on dormant orchards in the San
Joaquin Valley, California. Ambient air samples were collected and analyzed at an orchard site for each of 11 days
during the most intensive period of spraying. The levels
of diazinon residue (in mg/m3) during the day and at night
are recorded in the table. The researchers want to know
whether the mean diazinon residue levels differ from day
to night.
